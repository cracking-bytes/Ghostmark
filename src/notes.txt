file = open("filename.txt", "mode")

'r' - Read
'w' - Write (creates/overwrites)
'a' - append to end
'rb' - read in binary
'wb' - write in binary

content = file.read()
lines = file.readlines()
file.write("hhllo")
file.close()

with open("filename.txt", 'r')
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
